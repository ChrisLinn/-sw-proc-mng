# Planning and Scheduling

## Project Plan
* proj mng plan `!=` proj plan
    - PMP contain all plans
    - proj plan is just about the schedule
+ What does it include
    * the __task__ that need to be carried out as part of the processes that are being followed
    * the __duration__ and __dependencies__ for each task
    * the __people__ and __physical res__ required by each task
    * __milestones__ or __goals__ of each task
        - milestones: particular __important__ achievements
            + to track progress


## Basic Plainning Concepts
+ Compartmentalise
    * break down into smaller pieces
+ Interdependency
    * are there any dependencies between tasks or resources
+ Effort Estimation/Validation
+ Time Allocation
+ Responsibilities
+ Outcomes/Goals
+ Milestones


## People and Effort
+ A common measure for estimating the effort for software is _man-months_ (more generally _person-months_)
+ person-moths
    * the time in months for a single person working full time to complete the tasks
+ The Mythical Man-Months
+ Putman-Norden-Rayleigh curve
    * ~~waste effort? time?~~
    * dev time too long, effort cost goes up

## Project Scheduling

### Work Breakdown
+ start by choosing the SDLC
+ Breakdown the work tasks - __Work Breakdown Structure__
    * e.g. waterfall model
        - Concept
        - Req
        - Design
        - Impl
        - Acceptance Testing
+ 100% rule
    * Work breakdown structure includes 100% of the work defined by the project scope and capture _...???_

### Dependencies
+ Dependencies are caused by:
    * a task needing a work prod of anpther task
    * a task _...??_
+ _...???_

### Task Network

### PERT and Gantt 

### Critical Path Methods

















## Proj Sche
+ Two important q not answered so far
    * how long wil the sys take to dev
    * how much wil it cost
+ two widely used graphical notations
    * PERT ()
        - ....
        - PERT Charts
            + Terminology
                * predecessor node
                * successor node
                * optimistic time (O)
                * pessimistic time (P)
                * most likely time (M)
                * expected time (TE)
    * An activity network that shows the dependencies among tass and the __critical tasks__

## important concepts
+ milestone
+ actiibty
+ free float, free slack
    * how long can a task be finished without affecting the next task
+ total float, to
    * how much can I change without affect the whole sche 
+ Critical path
    * longest path
    * any activity changed longer, the total time gets longer
+ Critical activity
    * any activity in the critical path
