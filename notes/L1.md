# Lecture 1  Intro to software engineering/development

## what is software
+ both a solution and a problem
    * how to dev
    * how to dev free of bugs

## software engineering
* steps
    - identify the problem
    - analyse the problem
    - derive solutions to the problem
    - most appropriate solution
        - realise the solution
+ def
    * the application of engineering (systematic, disciplined, quantifiable)  principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software and
    * the study of how
+ why we need it
    * sw is becoming more and more complex

## sw sys
+ def
    + a set of programs, hardware components, networks and other devices that are inter-connected and work together to acheive a common goal
- design
    + physical layout
    + reliability of components
    + performance of components
    + other factor
