# The Monitoring Disciplines
## Monitoring and SPM
Be able to measure and analyse info

+ Estimates for future performance
+ Compare actual against predictions
+ Assess quality of outputs & activities

## Measurement, Metrics and Indicators
+ Measurement
    * Measurement fundamental to any Eng discipline. _"To measure is to know."_
        - Characterise
            + understanding of process, products, resources and environment (baselines)
        - Evaluate
            +  what is the __status__ of plans
        - Predict
            + better understand _relationships_
        - Improve
            + bottlenecks/roadblocks, root causes of problems
                + how to change
+ Metrics in SE
    * Metrics types
        - Process Metrics
            + All projects __OVER TIME__
        - Project Metrics
            + Single project
        - Product Metrics
            + A single product as it evolves
                * Can only measure this late in the SDLC
+ Measuring indicators
    + An indicator is a 'thing' that indicates the __state__ or __level__ of measurement
        - process
            + __efficacy__ of existing process __???__
                + paradigm
                + SE tasks
                + work products
                + milestones
        - proj
            + assess the __status__ of an ongoing project
            + tracking potential __risks__
            + __uncover problems__ areas before they go 'critical'
            + __adjust__ workflow or tasks
            + __evaluate__ the team's ability to __control quality__ of the SW work products
+ The measuring process???
+ measuring complexity and sw??
    * cyclomeatic complexity
    * CK metrics suite
        - to neasure OO design complexity
            + Weighted methods per class (WMC)
            + depth of the inheritance tree (DIT)
            + num of children (NOC)
            + (RFC)
    * function point analysis
        - all the steps of function point
            + why using func points
                * estimate cost and effort to design, code and test a sw sys
                * predict the num of errors
                * predict num of components in sw
            + how
                * categorizing functions
                    - Internal Logical File (ILF) - data
                    - External Input (EI) - transaction
                    - External Output (EO) - transaction
                    - External Inquiry/Query (EQ) - transaction



## Cost and Estimates
+ WHEN DOES ESTIMATION START?
    * SW PM starts with Project __planning__
    * Estimation looks into the __future__
    * Accept some degree of uncertainty
        * some _'guesstimation'_
- Estimations variables
    + Estimate
        + resources, cost and schedule for SW development
            - Experience important & historical info
            + Risky task
                * uncertainty
    - Project complexity
        + uncertainty inherent to planning
        - Complexity is relative
    - Project size
        - impact accuracy of estimates 
        - Decomposition to manage this
    - Structural uncertainty __???__
        + RQâ€™s solid?
        + Looking back, comprehensive metrics
