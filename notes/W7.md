+ Challenges to today’s PM
    * PM - one of the most dynamic management fields
        - Applying: knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to meet project requirements
        - 47 logically grouped PM processes
            + Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling and closing
        - Apart from the processes ‒ the teamwork
            + Communication, coordination, + intellectually intensive work + learning + conflicts, issues, team building.........
+ PM today
    * The world of has changed
        - User(s) in centre of the design process
        - Focus on collaboration & networking
        - __Smaller__ teams with __short__ cycles of success
    * Emphasize - Agile __not for all projects__
    * Principal nature of SW PM has not changed dramatically
    * 21st century sw-intensive system vary
        - size, content, complexity, degree of interaction with other system
    * Prior PM efforts were __plan-driven__ SW development
    * Dynamic Project Management
        - A supportive and responsive way of managing projects that work WITH the needs of teams
+ PM and Agile
    * Agile shortens one’s development cycles
        - highly Agile stats
            + 75% meet business goals or intent
            + 65% finish on time
            + 67% finish within budget
    * agile is
        - A different philosophy
        - Has its own __challenges__ (risks)
            + There is resistance to acceptance of Agile principles
            + Less experienced team members are not exposed to the customer
            + The backlog is not well groomed, leading to poorer use of resources/unnecessary pressure toward the end of the sprint
            + The spirit of Agile is not maintained over time
            + Teams do not understand Agile estimations and over- or undercommit
            + Frequent changes in team composition nullify the team's velocity/capacity
            + The sprint commitment is not met
                * could be due to complex work, unavailability of key resources, faulty estimations, dependence on third parties, and so on
            + The team is occupied fixing defects from previous sprints
        - Needs continuous user involvement
        - Is built on agility and creativity of teamwork
        - . . . is worth giving a GO!
    * PM tools
        - Teams need good tools to handle multiple projects
        - Modern PM software ‒ __real-time__
        - PM Systems -> PM Apps/tools
            + Open source
            + __Integrated__ with work practices
            + __Real-time__ workspaces for team members and outsides to see: progress and nitty-gritty details
            + __No need__ to performance manage teams!
            + example
                * Details of Projects
                * Milestones, tasks and subtasks
                * Start of tasks/springts, dates, deliverables
                * Assignment of tasks to persons, deadline
                * Transparency ‒ others see who does what, when, multiple tasks etc.
                * Visibility ‒ see who is falling behind ‒ e.g. who has task in the Doing lane for longer than expected
                * Easily spot slips and reorganise
                * Projects ‘assets’ eg. detailed project descriptions of its parts to visual mock-ups
                * Project members need access to these ‘assets’
                * PM tool a shared ‘The Central Place’ for all project team members
                * Adequate ‘storage’ space is necessary
                * Increase in availability of free open access tools (some limitations)
    * __Collaboration & Comm__ tools
        - Little different to PM Apps/tools
        - Collaborative tools facilitate team member __interaction__ (VideoConf tools or synchronous editing of artefacts)
        - Slack, Hipchat, Google Docs, chat tools
        - Team log into one workspace, can access different elements driving individuality, creativity & teamwork
    * __Tasks management__ tools
