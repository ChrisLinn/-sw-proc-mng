    1. Proposition 1: The classical formal lifecycles of software engineering, such as the waterfall or increment models, are for stuﬀy old software engineering dinosaurs. The world has moved on, and agile practices are the only sensible way moving forward, because they focus on coding.
    2. Proposition 2: In risk management, all we really need is an estimate of the probability of a risky event occurring. The impact is not relevant because a low probability event is not worth considering.
    3. Proposition 3: The only technique really needed for requirements elicitation are interviews.
