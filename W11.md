# Quality Assurance & Quality Monitoring

_updated at: 2017-05-23-10-09_

+ ~~Quality Assurance~~
    + ~~to achieve quality standards~~
        * ~~quality standards~~
            - ~~one of the constraints~~
                + ~~other constraints~~
                    * ~~budget~~
                    * ~~resource~~
                    * ~~product~~
                    * ~~organizational~~


## Quality
+ ~~is an attribute (that can be broken into some attributes) and is measurable~~
+ cannot post-hoc / after building the system
+ need to be Built into the Design (at the beginning)
+ kind of quality
    * QUALITY OF DESIGN
    * QUALITY OF CONFORMANCE
+ the quality of the process influences the quality of the product
    * If a software engineer cannot directly monitor the quality attributes of the product
        * then they will often instead monitor the quality attributes of the processes used
+ Perspective on quality
    * The end user perspective - ultimately matters
        - external quality characteristics
            + fit for purpose
            + reliable
            + reasonable performance
            + easy to learn and use
            + help user in achieving their goal
    * The developer’s perspective -  increases the likelihood to satisfy the end user
        - internal quality characteristics - easy to understand and maintain for developers and maintainers, so that less likely to make mistakes, and can focus on increasing quality with respect to the end user
            + num of faults
            + ease of modifying the system
            + ease of testing the system
            + the ease of understanding the system design
            + the re-usability of components
            + conformance to requirements
            + resource usage
            + performance
- quality dependent on the perspective, interpretation, and expectations of individuals
    +  difﬁcult to measure or assess directly
        *  wanna remove bias and be more objective
            - use quality models
                + to decompose quality into a number of attributes which can be measured or evaluated more objectively
        
### Quality models
+ a relatively abstract characterisation of quality
    * Meets explicit functional & non-functional req’s
        - correct, complete, consistent
    * Adhere internal & external standards
    * Meets implicit quality req’s
        - req's for performance - reliable, usable, extendable ...
+ ~~example~~
    * ~~McCall’s quality model~~
    * ~~ISO9126~~

### SW quality dilemma
+ which process and activities are worthwhile to apply in order to achieve software quality
    * why ask
        - quality assurance has a cost
            + ~~salary~~
            + ~~software licenses~~
            + ~~hardware~~
            + ~~time~~
        - lack of quality also has a cost
            + ~~user to deal with low quality~~
            + ~~supplier to knock-on~~
                * ~~potential users don't choose~~
                * ~~current user don't upgrade~~
            + ~~supplier to maintain~~
                * ~~faults more common~~
                * ~~hard to make changes~~
                    - ~~correcting fault~~
                    - ~~adding new features~~
                    - ~~re-factoring~~
    + answer
        * good enough (e.g. more-used more reliable / no known faults)
            - need to estimate
                + cost of the quality assurance activities
                + the cost of the possible risks

### The cost of quality
+ too costly?
    * ~~e.g.~~
        + ~~no formal team reviews, ask user instead for feedback and correct faults~~
        + ~~release the system and correct errors as users find/report them~~
    * Studies indicate that
        * later a fault is detected (in SDLC)
            * more costly to locate and repair

## Quality Assurance
+ __monitoring and evaluation__ of the various aspects of a project, service, or facility to ensure that __standards__ of quality are being met.
+ != guarantee
    * ~~only to provide a high level of assurance, or a high degree of confidence~~
        - ~~that the program meets the needs~~
+ != quality control
    * quality assurance
        - to improve quality during development
    * quality control
        * testing a product before its release
        - to decide whether to release
+ ~~ability to exert control over the level of assurance~~
    * ~~important~~
    * ~~distinguishes engineering from ad-hoc development~~
    * ~~need to understand the quality attributes~~
    * ~~have methods to build these attributes~~


## Product vs. Process
