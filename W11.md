# Quality Assurance & Quality Monitoring

_updated at: 2017-05-22-21-09_

+ ~~Quality Assurance~~
    + ~~to achieve quality standards~~
        * ~~quality standards~~
            - ~~one of the constraints~~
                + ~~other constraints~~
                    * ~~budget~~
                    * ~~resource~~
                    * ~~product~~
                    * ~~organizational~~

## what is quality
+ ~~is an attribute (that can be broken into some attributes) and is measurable~~
+ cannot post-hoc / after building the system
+ need to be Built into the Design (at the beginning)
+ kind of quality
    * QUALITY OF DESIGN
    * QUALITY OF CONFORMANCE
+ the quality of the process influences the quality of the product
    * If a software engineer cannot directly monitor the quality attributes of the product
        * then they will often instead monitor the quality attributes of the processes used
+ Perspective on quality
    * The end user perspective - ultimately matters
        - external quality characteristics
            + fit for purpose
            + reliable
            + reasonable performance
            + easy to learn and use
            + help user in achieving their goal
    * The developer’s perspective -  increases the likelihood to satisfy the end user
        - internal quality characteristics - easy to understand and maintain for developers and maintainers, so that less likely to make mistakes, and can focus on increasing quality with respect to the end user
            + num of faults
            + ease of modifying the system
            + ease of testing the system
            + the ease of understanding the system design
            + the re-usability of components
            + conformance to requirements
            + resource usage
            + performance
- quality dependent on the perspective, interpretation, and expectations of individuals
    +  difﬁcult to measure or assess directly
        *  wanna remove bias and be more objective
            - use quality models
                + to decompose quality into a number of attributes which can be measured or evaluated more objectively
        
### Quality Models
+ a relatively abstract characterisation of quality
    * Meets explicit functional & non-functional req’s
        - correct, complete, consistent
    * Adhere internal & external standards
    * Meets implicit quality req’s
        - req's for performance - reliable, usable, extendable ...
+ ~~example~~
    * ~~McCall’s quality model~~
    * ~~ISO9126~~
