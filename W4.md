# Planning and Scheduling

_updated at: 2017-05-22-21-09_

## Project Plan
* proj mng plan `!=` proj plan
    - PMP contain all plans
    - proj plan is just about the schedule
+ What does it include
    * the __task__ that need to be carried out as part of the processes that are being followed
    * the __duration__ and __dependencies__ for each task
    * the __people__ and __physical res__ required by each task
    * __milestones__ or __goals__ of each task
        - milestones: particular __important__ achievements
            + to track progress
+ why do it
    * to analyse the people, projects and processes early in the planning phases of a project to arrive at more realistic schedules
        - ~~if estimated schedule exceeds the given deadline~~
            + ~~discuss with the client~~
                * ~~if schedule modification not accepted~~
                    - ~~prefer iterative or incremental models with management structures that support shorter deadlines and phased delivery~~


## Basic Plainning Concepts
+ Compartmentalise
    * break down into smaller pieces
+ Interdependency
    * are there any dependencies between tasks or resources
+ Effort Estimation/Validation
+ Time Allocation
+ Responsibilities
+ Outcomes/Goals
+ Milestones


## People and Effort
+ A common measure for estimating the effort for software is _man-months_ (more generally _person-months_)
    * person-moths
        - the time in months for a single person working full time to complete the tasks
    * The Mythical Man-Months
        - ~~man-months is a misleading measure to estimate software~~
        - ~~adding people to a project that is behind schedule could result in more
        disruption and more delay~~
            * ~~because~~
                * ~~unfamiliarity~~
                    - ~~need to help new people~~
                * ~~more communication channels~~
    - A common myth is that if a project is behind schedule then the schedule can be shortened simply by adding more resources
    * Putman-Norden-Rayleigh curve
        - ~~waste effort? time?~~
        - ![Putnam-Norden-Rayleigh curve](pics/Putnam-Norden-Rayleigh-curve.png)
        - dev time too long, effort cost goes up
        - empirical

## Project Scheduling

### Work Breakdown
+ start by choosing the SDLC
+ Breakdown the work tasks 
    * e.g. waterfall model
        - Concept
        - Requirements
        - Design
        - Impl
        - Acceptance Testing
    + results in __Work Breakdown Structure__
        + ![Work Breakdown Structure](pics/work-breakdown-structure.png)
        - 100% rule
            + to define the work breakdown structure
            + Work breakdown structure includes 100% of the work defined by the project scope and captures all deliverables ~~— internal, external, and interim — in terms of the work to be completed, including all project management.~~
                * ~~not always possible in the early stages~~
                    - ~~as new work-packages are identiﬁed then they must all be built into the existing work breakdown structure and into the project plan~~


### Dependencies
+ Dependencies are caused by:
    * a task needs a work product produced by another task
    * a task relies on a work product (developed by another task) to be in a specific state before it can commence
    * a task needs resources used by another task
+ __Task Network__ captures the dependencies between tasks


### Task Network
+ ![Task Network](pics/task_nw.png)


### PERT and Gantt
+ to answer
    - how long will the sys take to dev
    - how much will it cost
* Two widely used graphical notations 
    - Activity charts
        + show the dependencies between tasks and show the critical path for the project
    - Barcharts
        + show the schedule of tasks against calendar time
        + such as Gantt charts
            * ~~presents the same kind of information as a PERT chart except that it shows the duration of each activity against calendar time, which PERT charts do not~~
            * ~~a tabular representation of the project schedule~~
                * ~~can be used to present a large amount of information in a relatively compact form~~

#### Important concepts
+ Milestone
    * represent the completion of an activity or the delivery of work-product
    * ~~an event that takes zero time~~
+ Activity
    * part of a project that requires resources and time
+ Free float, free slack
    * the amount of time that a task can be delayed without causing a delay to subsequent tasks
+ Total float, total slack
    * the amount of time that a task can be delayed without delaying project completion
+ Critical path
    * longest possible continuous path ~~taken from the initial event to the terminal event~~
    * ~~determines the total calendar time~~
    * ~~any time delays along the critical path will delay the reaching of the terminal event by at least the same amount~~
+ Critical activity
    * any activity in the critical path
    * an activity that has 0 total float


#### PERT Charts
+ ![PERT_Charts.png](pics/PERT_Charts.png)
+ Program Evaluation and Review Technique charts
    + An activity network that shows the dependencies among tasks and the __critical path__.
    + Terminology
        - predecessor node
        - successor node
        - optimistic time (O)
            + ~~minimum possible time required to accomplish a task~~
                * ~~assuming everything proceeds better than expected~~
        - pessimistic time (P)
            + ~~maximum possible time required to accomplish a task~~
                * ~~assuming everything proceeds goes wrong~~
        - most likely time (M)
            + ~~best estimate of the time required to accomplish a task~~
                * ~~assuming everything proceeds as normal~~
        - expected time (TE)
            + ~~the average time the task would require if repeated~~
        - $TE = (O+4M+P)/6$
        - Earliest start time (ES)
        - Latest start time (LS)
        - Earliest ﬁnish time (EF)
        - Latest ﬁnish time (LF)
        - Slack time
    * node
        - ![PERT_node](pics/PERT_node.png)
    * dependencies
        - ![PERT_dependencies](pics/PERT_dependencies.png)


####  Gantt chart
+ A bar chart that show the schedule against a calendar

    - ![Gantt How To 1](pics/gantt-how-to-1.png)
    - ![Gantt How To 2](pics/gantt-how-to-2.png)


### Critical Path Methods
+ Critical path
    * path with the longest duration
    * activities on the critical path have a total free slack of 0
    * any activity gets longer, the total time gets longer
        - a delay in any of the activities in the critical path will cause the project to delay
+ Crashing the project plan
    + shortening the total duration of the project by shortening the critical path
        * By removing the dependencies between activities in the critical path; or 
        * Shortening the duration of activities in the critical path

### Project Tracking and Control
+ Period __reviews__ where team members report __progress__
+ __Evaluating__ the results of reviews and audits conducted as part of the software engineering process
+ Tracking formal project __milestones__
+ Comparing __actual start__ dates with scheduled start dates
+ Meeting __engineers__ and having informal discussions
+ Using a formal method like __earned value analysis__

### Common reasons for project failure
+ Unrealistic deadlines
+ Changing requirements
+ Underestimate of the efforts
+ Unmanaged risks
+ Technical difficulties
+ Human resource difficulties
+ Failure to see and act on slippage
+ Miscommunications between project staff


### Planning in agile development
+ Takes a significantly different flavour from traditional approaches
+ Detailed planning is differed __until the start__ of the iteration
    + Designed to handle __change__
    + An iteration includes __all phases__ (requirements, design and test)
+ Planning is based on __light weight lists__
    + Gantt and PERT charts are considered __less useful__
* Plan __short__ iterations
+ Produce useful functionality
+ Use “Just in time (__JIT__) planning” – next iteration
+ Use the __team__
