+ Challenges to today’s PM
    * ~~PM - one of the most dynamic management fields~~
        - ~~Applying: knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to meet project requirements~~
        - 47 logically grouped PM processes
            + Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling and closing
        - Apart from the processes ‒ the teamwork
            + ~~Communication, coordination, + intellectually intensive work + learning + conflicts, issues, team building.........~~
+ PM today
    * ~~The world of has changed~~
        - __User__(s) in centre of the design process
        - Focus on __collaboration & networking__
        - __Smaller__ teams with __short__ cycles of success
    * Emphasize - Agile __not for all projects__
    * Principal nature of SW PM has not changed dramatically
    * ~~21st century sw-intensive system vary~~
        - ~~size, content, complexity, degree of interaction with other system~~
    * Prior PM efforts were __plan-driven__ SW development
    * __Dynamic__ Project Management
        - ~~A supportive and responsive way of managing projects that work WITH the needs of teams~~
+ PM and Agile
    * Agile shortens one’s development cycles
        - ~~highly Agile stats~~
            + ~~75% meet business goals or intent~~
            + ~~65% finish on time~~
            + ~~67% finish within budget~~
    * how does one adapt from a traditional PM style to Agile PM style
        1. What new tools and techniques do I need to manage Agile projects
            + visual board
            + scrum timeline
                * because
                    * need grooming backlog regularly
                        * need clients to keep telling what to do
                            * ~~cannot make a plan in advance, carry the plan through the completion, and expect to deliver what the client what at the date of the completion~~
            + some democratic discipline
        2. I used to Plan for the entire project  upfront when working on Waterfall projects. How do I plan now?
            + upfront
                * future changes
                * waste of investment
            + now
                * continuous communication
                    - check what the users need
                    * ~~need to deliver what users want now instead of 2 weeks ago~~
        3. A a PM, I used to manage large projects. For Agile will I still manage the whole project or how will I now manage?
            + large projects
                + a lot of requirements
                + time lag in delivery
                + ~~illusion~~
                    + ~~you know what's gonna happen in the future~~
                    + ~~can plan for it~~
                    + ~~plan your delivery~~
                + likely (80%) to fail
            - need to break down
        4. What are typical Risks that I now have to look out for as an Agile PM? 
            + same as others but explored early
            + Eileen didn't actually answer this question
        5. I really love my old Gantt Chart Will I still be able to use this chart when I’m an Agile PM?
            + no
        6. The teams.... I used to put the teams together but do I have to do so for self-organizing teams?
            + yes
            + ~~not only for initiation stage (envision stage)~~
                + ~~put people together who wanna work together~~
            + ~~have conflict mng strategy~~
                * ~~should focus on relationship instead of conflicts~~
                    * ~~people themselves can work through it~~
                    - ~~each person in the conflict ignores the other person's points of view~~ 
                    * ~~change working habits~~
                        * ~~change people (membership) if fail~~
        7. If I have a dispute in a team, what is the best technique for resolving disputes in teams?
            + conflict mng
        8. Tips for me... What shall I forget in terms of my ‘older PM’ skills to manage Agile projects? 
            + defining the deliverables to your clients
                * ~~but mng the stakeholders carefully~~
                    - ~~because they are paying for what you do~~
            + promising sth in advance
                * ~~deliver early~~
                * ~~get out of the way if have good developer~~
                * still need to monitor, deliver and advise to your stakeholders
                    * communicate about the progress
    * agile is
        - ~~A different philosophy~~
        - Has its own challenges (risks)
            + ~~There is resistance to acceptance of Agile principles~~
            + ~~Less experienced team members are not exposed to the customer~~
            + ~~The backlog is not well groomed, leading to poorer use of resources/unnecessary pressure toward the end of the sprint~~
            + ~~The spirit of Agile is not maintained over time~~
            + ~~Teams do not understand Agile estimations and over- or undercommit~~
            + ~~Frequent changes in team composition nullify the team's velocity/capacity~~
            + ~~The sprint commitment is not met~~
                * ~~could be due to complex work, unavailability of key resources, faulty estimations, dependence on third parties, and so on~~
            + ~~The team is occupied fixing defects from previous sprints~~
        - Needs continuous user involvement
        - Is built on agility and creativity of teamwork
        - ~~. . . is worth giving a GO!~~
    * PM tools
        - ~~Teams need good tools to handle multiple projects~~
        - ~~Modern PM software ‒ __real-time__~~
        - PM Systems -> PM Apps/tools
            + Open source
            + __Integrated__ with work practices
            + __Real-time__ workspaces for team members and outsides to see: progress and nitty-gritty details
            + __No need__ to performance manage teams!
            + example
                * Details of Projects
                * Milestones, tasks and subtasks
                * Start of tasks/springts, dates, deliverables
                * Assignment of tasks to persons, deadline
                * Transparency ‒ others see who does what, when, multiple tasks etc.
                * Visibility ‒ see who is falling behind ‒ e.g. who has task in the Doing lane for longer than expected
                * ~~Easily spot slips and reorganise~~
                * ~~Projects ‘assets’ eg. detailed project descriptions of its parts to visual mock-ups~~
                    * ~~Project members need access to these ‘assets’~~
                * ~~PM tool a shared ‘The Central Place’ for all project team members~~
                * ~~Adequate ‘storage’ space is necessary~~
                * ~~Increase in availability of free open access tools (some limitations)~~
    * __Collaboration & Comm__ tools
        - ~~Little different to PM Apps/tools~~
        - Collaborative tools facilitate team member __interaction__ ~~(VideoConf tools or synchronous editing of artefacts)~~
            - Slack, Hipchat, Google Docs, chat tools
        - Team log into one workspace, can access different elements driving individuality, creativity & teamwork
    * __Tasks management__ tools
        - including
            + PM apps include Task Management features
                * Asana (workflow management tools)
            + Others include Kanban boards (visual)
                * Trello
            + To-do list software
                * Todoist
                * Wunderlist
        - Features of tools from a cognitive viewpoint are important
